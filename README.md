# Hi — I'm Nisarg Patel 👋

I'm a software engineer passionate about blockchain, web3, API-driven backend systems and full-stack JavaScript/React development.

## 🚀 What I build  
- 🔐 **crypto-wallet** — a Bitcoin self-custody wallet built with Node.js and React; allows wallet generation, private-key management, and Testnet transactions.  
- 🤖 **Smart-contract & blockchain dev** — practicing Ethereum contract writing with Solidity and building skills around fintech/blockchain.  
- 🛠️ **Backend & APIs** — building robust REST APIs using Node.js and Express.  
- 🌐 **Front-end apps** — using React and modern JS to build responsive web apps (e.g. Movie-Search app using external REST APIs).
